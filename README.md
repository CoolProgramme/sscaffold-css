## Introduction

sscaffold combines css rules from [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), [skeleton.css](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton), and [milligram](https://github.com/milligram/milligram) into a single, reorganized, easy-to-use css file, with bugfixes and a few other updates and additions. It emphasizes sensible defaults and semantic HTML.


## Using sscaffold

This is currently in a pre-release state. I have at least one known bug to fix and then it'll be getting added to cdnjs.

If you want it added to your favorite repository / dependency management system, open an issue requesting it so that I know it's worth the trouble and I'll get on it.


## Documentation

The [sscaffold-css.com](https://sscaffold-css.com/) home page is a demo and brief overview of the current release.

Complete documentation is currently underway.
