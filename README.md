## Introduction

sscaffold combines css rules from [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), [skeleton.css](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton), and [milligram](https://github.com/milligram/milligram) into a single, reorganized, easy-to-use css file, with bugfixes and a few other updates and additions. It emphasizes sensible defaults and semantic HTML.


## Using sscaffold

I'm releasing it now as a preview. Full documentation and any final bugfixes should be completed before the 0.1.0 release. Once 0.1.0 is released, I'll see about getting it onto cdnjs and then following a semantic versioning system from there.

If you want it added to your favorite repository / dependency management system, open an issue requesting it so that I know it's worth doing and I'll get on it.


## Documentation

The [sscaffold-css.com](https://sscaffold-css.com/) home page is a demo and brief overview of the current release.

Complete documentation is available at [doc.sscaffold-css.com](https://doc.sscaffold-css.com/).
